                <p class="inspirationp"> These recipes have been selected from the various successful kitchen experiments I’ve made over the years. As a college student, it can be difficult to find the time and money to cook for yourself. It’s also easy to fall subject to the indecision of what to eat. I’ve created this collection of recipes to share and hopefully inspire anyone trying to cook healthy, affordable, and time efficient meals!</p>

            <p>  <strong>Philosophy: </strong> Being healthy doesn’t mean counting calories or always eating vegetables. It’s important to meet your nutritional needs while enjoying what you make. Sometimes cooking can feel like a hassle, but it doesn’t have to. I believe the key to a healthy diet is eating regularly and not straining yourself to make it happen. It’s easy to skip meals and order out when you aren’t feeling passionate or inspired about your food options. I hope this site will help broaden your horizons and inspire you to cook for yourself more!

            <h2> About Me</h2>
            </header>
            <p> My name is Lucinda Strol and I’m a junior at Syracuse University. I’ve been cooking and baking since I was around 10-years-old. The first food I remember learning to cook was oatmeal with my mom in the mornings before elementary school. Throughout middle and high school, I spent a lot of time watching Cake Boss and baking pies, cakes, and cookies. My parents raised me on all-organic, non-processed food, so eating wholesome and healthy food remains one of my biggest priorities to this day. I wouldn’t call myself the best cook ever, but making food is something I enjoy a lot. Moving into my own apartment this year meant that I would have to cook and shop for myself regularly. I’m still learning how much is the right amount to spend at Trader Joes and remembering to turn off the stove, but I’ve definitely learned a lot in the past 6 months and want to share some of my tips and go-to recipes!
