                            <p>This ravioli recipe is not only super tasty, but is a lot of fun to make. You can easily customize its contents, from creamy spinach and ricotta, to savory bolognese. This dish is perfect to share with friends or save in the fridge.</p>

                            <h3 class="featuredhead">Chicken & Chickpea Salad</h3>
                            <p> This salad recipe takes minutes to make and is customizable to your own personal taste. Adding chickpeas is a great source of protein and will make sure to fill you up. I typically dress this salad with olive oil and salt but feel free to use your favorite dressing.</p>

                            <h3 class="featuredhead">Avocado & Turkey Sandwich</h3>
                            <p> I actually found this recipe on Tik Tok and it has become one of my favorite things to make. Using pesto and avocado as a spread compliments the turkey and arugula perfectly. I make this meal everytime I come back starving from my long Tues/Thurs class grind.</p>

                            <p> Have you ever been craving pizza but can't afford to pay those hefty delivery fees? This fun twist on a classic Italian favorite will satisy your cravings without breaking the bank. Pan pizza is a quick, simple, and healthy alternative.</p>

                            <h3 class="featuredhead">Kale & Spinach Salad</h3>
                            <p>This salad was a great change from my typical caesar salad routine which was getting very old. I have come to love this recipe because feels very healthy, but doesn't taste healthy to the point where it's hard to finish.</p>

                            <p> Of course I had to include the classic Gigi Hadid penne alla vodka recipe. I'm sure most people are very familiar with this pasta, but just incase it's been lost in the ages of quarantine, here is your sign to make it again. </p>
